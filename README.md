# SAVE - Students Analyzing Violent Economics

Our project, SAVE (Students Analyzing Violent Economics), analyzes the correlation between crime and income in Colorado. By integrating a Google heat map with crime and income data, we were able to discover and show the relationship between the crime in Colorado and as well as the locations of higher income.

Using the Heat Map and Python analysis we came to a conclusion that areas with higher income have less crime compared to those with lower income.
